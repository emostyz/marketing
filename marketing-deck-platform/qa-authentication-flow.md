**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS

### 6. Navigation Consistency Test
**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to each public page without being logged in
2. Check navigation header consistency
3. Verify all links work properly

**Pages Tested:**
- `/` (Homepage)
- `/pricing` 
- `/about`
- `/contact`
- `/demo`
- `/enterprise`

**Expected Result:**
- All pages use shared `PublicPageLayout`
- Navigation header is consistent across all pages
- Active page highlighting works
- Mobile responsive menu functions
- Footer is consistent

**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS (Fixed: All pages now use PublicPageLayout)

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Demo API Response Structure
**Problem:** Demo API endpoint returned incomplete session data
**Fix:** Updated `/api/auth/test` to return proper demo session structure with expiration and features

### Issue 2: Demo Page Template Fallback
**Problem:** Demo page required template parameter, caused errors when accessed directly
**Fix:** Added default template fallback to executive-summary when no template specified

### Issue 3: Signup User State
**Problem:** User state not set immediately after signup, could cause issues with welcome page
**Fix:** Added user state setting in signup function after successful account creation

### Issue 4: Navigation Inconsistency
**Problem:** Public pages had different navigation implementations
**Fix:** Created shared PublicPageLayout component and updated all public pages to use it

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Error Boundaries
- Implement error boundaries around authentication components
- Add fallback UI for authentication failures

### 2. Enhance Demo Mode
- Add demo mode indicator in navigation
- Show remaining demo time
- Add upgrade prompts for demo users

### 3. Improve User Feedback
- Add loading states during authentication
- Show success/error toasts for better UX
- Add progress indicators for multi-step signup

### 4. Session Management
- Implement auto-logout for demo sessions
- Add session timeout warnings
- Improve error handling for expired sessions

## Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests:** 6
- **Passed:** 6 ‚úÖ
- **Failed:** 0 ‚ùå
- **Overall Status:** PASS ‚úÖ

All critical authentication flows are working correctly. The system properly handles:
- User registration with comprehensive data collection
- Standard login/logout
- Demo mode with proper session management
- Navigation consistency across public pages
- Proper redirects and state management

## Next Steps
1. Implement full feedback loop with Supabase (remaining todo item)
2. Add comprehensive error handling and loading states
3. Implement session timeout and auto-refresh functionality
4. Add analytics tracking for authentication events
