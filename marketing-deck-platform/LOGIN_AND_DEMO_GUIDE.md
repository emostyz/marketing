3. You'll be redirected to the dashboard with full access
4. No account creation or email confirmation needed

2. Fill in your details with a **real email address** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Check your email for confirmation link
4. Click the confirmation link

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Email address is invalid"
- **Solution**: Use a real email address (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
- **Avoid**: `test@example.com`, `user@test.com` - these are blocked by Supabase

### "Email not confirmed"
- **Solution**: Check your email and click the confirmation link
- **Alternative**: Use demo mode instead

### "Demo button not working"
- **Solution**: The demo button should work. If it doesn't, try refreshing the page
- **Alternative**: Go directly to `/demo`

## Testing the System

### Test Demo Mode:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"demo": true}'
```

### Test Registration:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test User", "email": "your-real-email@gmail.com", "password": "testpass123"}'
```

### Test Login (after email confirmation):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-real-email@gmail.com", "password": "testpass123"}'
```

## Database Status

The system requires the following database tables to be created in Supabase:
- `profiles`
- `user_events`
- `system_events`
- `leads`

Run the migration file `supabase-clean-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor to create these tables.

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate testing**: Use demo mode
2. **For real accounts**: Create account with real email and confirm it
3. **For development**: The system is ready for full development
