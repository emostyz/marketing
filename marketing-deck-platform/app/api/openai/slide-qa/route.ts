3. INSIGHTFUL: Does this slide reveal game-changing insights or non-obvious patterns?
4. BEAUTIFUL: Is this slide visually stunning and executive-ready?

ADDITIONAL CRITERIA:
- Executive-ready content (no fluff, pure value)
- Clear narrative flow and logical structure
- Professional visual design that commands attention
- Actionable insights that drive decision-making

Your response must be a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "verdict": "KEEP" | "KILL",
  "scores": {
    "helpful": 1-10,
    "useful": 1-10, 
    "insightful": 1-10,
    "beautiful": 1-10,
    "executiveReady": 1-10,
    "overall": 1-10
  },
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of your assessment",
  "improvements": ["suggestion 1", "suggestion 2", ...],

- Is this slide USEFUL for immediate executive action?

- Not appropriate for executive-level audience
- Fails to meet McKinsey/BCG presentation standards

Only slides that excel on ALL criteria should be KEEP.`
